<h1>TWO COLOUMN LAYOUT</h1>
<div  class="l">Suppose that in a conductor, the number of free electrons
available per m3 of the conductor material is n and let their
axial drift velocity be ν metres/second. In time dt, distance
travelled would be ν × dt. If A is area of cross-section of the
conductor, then the volume is νAdt and the number of electrons
contained in this volume is νA dt. Obviously, all these
electrons will cross the conductor cross-section in time dt. If
e is the charge of each electron, then total charge which crosses
the section in time dt is dq = nAeν dt.
Since current is the rate of flow of charge, it is given as
i = dq nAe dt
dt dt ν = ∴ i = nAeν
Current density, J = i/A = ne ν ampere/metre2
Assuming a normal current density J = 1.55 × 106 A/m2, n = 1029 for a copper conductor
and e = 1.6 × 10−19 coulomb, we get
1.55 × 106 = 1029 × 1.6 × 10−19 × ν ∴ ν = 9.7 × 10−5 m/s = 0.58 cm/min
It is seen that contrary to the common but mistaken view, the electron drift velocity is rather very
slow and is independent of the current flowing and the area of the conductor.
N.B.Current density i.e., the current per unit area, is a vector quantity. It is denoted by the symbol J
→
.
Therefore, in vector notation, the relationship between current I and J
→
is :
I = J . a
→ →
[where a
→
is the vector notation for area ‘a’]
For extending the scope of the above relationship, so that it becomes applicable for area of any shape, we
write :
I = J .da
The magnitude of the current density can, therefore, be written as J·α.
Example 1.1. A conductor material has a free-electron density of 1024 electrons per metre3.
When a voltage is applied, a constant drift velocity of 1.5 × 10−2 metre/second is attained by the
electrons. If the cross-sectional area of the material is 1 cm2, calculate the magnitude of the current.
Electronic charge is 1.6 × 10−19 coulomb. (Electrical Engg. Aligarh Muslim University)
Solution. The magnitude of the current is
i = nAeν amperes
Here, n = 1024 ; A = 1 cm2 = 10−4 m2
e = 1.6 × 10−19 C ; v = 1.5 × 10−2 m/s
∴ i = 1024 × 10−4 × 1.6 × 10−19 × 1.5 × 10−2 = 0.24 A
1.2. Charge Velocity and Velocity of Field Propagation
The speed with which charge drifts in a conductor is called the velocity of charge. As seen from
above, its value is quite low, typically fraction of a metre per second.
However, the speed with which the effect of e.m.f. is experienced at all parts of the conductor
resulting in the flow of current is called the velocity of propagation of electrical field. It is independent
of current and voltage and has high but constant value of nearly 3 × 108 m/s.
The electron moves at the
Fermi speed, and has only
a tiny drift velocity superimposed
by the applied electric field
